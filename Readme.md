### To Do 

Refacor the email repository so that we do not have to load the access token

- []Fix up the UI and make it look better 

- [x] Use a .net package to parse out the base 64 encoded email payloads 

- []Move the sql database used for local development into the cloud with azure (use terraform and keep the tf files local)
- [x] Setup the tf state and include the keyvault so that all the secrets can be pulled from there

Most important is setting up tf state and key vault
- [] Use caching on the emails page
- [] Add rate limiting to prevent DDOS and too many requests

### To Run 

install the dotnet ef tools on your computer 

run 
```dotnet ef migrations add {give a name}```
```dotnet ef databaase update```

If you are setting this up yourself you should just need to add your client id and secret for your app registered with google cloud platform
Add the same scopes that I am using
And either match the redirect uri that I have or add your own and make sure it is reflected in the Program.cs / appsettings
