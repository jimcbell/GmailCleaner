    <h1>Email Message Data</h1>
    <p>
        When users load Gmail Cleaner and request email analysis, certain data from their emails is saved for later confirmation without the need to use the Google API again.
    </p>
    <p>Here's a list of the data saved for emails identified as potential spam, these values are all encrypted at rest:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>FromEmail:</strong> The sender's email address.</li>
        <li><strong>Snippet:</strong> A small part of the email used for confirmation.</li>
        <li><strong>UnsubscribeLink:</strong> The link to unsubscribe from the email chain.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>None of this data is shared with third parties; it's only used for email deletion confirmation.</p>
    <p>Gmail Cleaner retains this data for one week; if there's no further action, it's automatically deleted. Confirmation of email deletion triggers immediate removal from the database.</p>
    <p>Users can also manually delete their data by clicking the "Clear Message Data" button on the Messages page.</p>
    <div class="btn-container">
        <a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg" asp-page="Messages" target="_blank">Remove Message Data</a>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>Google Account Data</h1>
    <p>In addition to email message data, minimal Google account information is saved, along with the permission granted during sign-in to access the user's Google account.</p>
    <p>This information is solely used for accessing email messages and is never shared with third parties.</p>
    <p>Users can revoke access to their Google account at any time using the button below.</p>
    <p>Revoking access disables Gmail Cleaner. After following the Google page link, users can delete all connections with Gmail Cleaner by clicking the respective button.</p>
    <strong>Please ensure email data is deleted before revoking access; this data is automatically deleted after a week. To remove it now, use the applicable button above.</strong>
